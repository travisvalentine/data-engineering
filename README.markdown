## Setup

There is a `seeds.rb` file that creates a test user. Credentials are as follows:

    **Email:** test@testing.com
    **Password:** password

To be able to login, the following should be adequate for setup:

1) Clone the Repo
2) Setup the DB/run the Seeds with `rake db:setup`
3) Start a Rails server locally with `rails s`
