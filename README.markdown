## Setup

There is a `seeds.rb` file that creates a test user. Credentials are as follows:

    Email: test@testing.com
    Password: password

To be able to login, the following should be adequate for setup:

* Clone the Repo
* Setup the DB/run the Seeds with `rake db:setup`
* Start a Rails server locally with `rails s`
